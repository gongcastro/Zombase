      <description>Hi! In this first post I will tell you a bit about this project, and what to expect from it in the short and mid term.
I love zombie-related material as much as I love making lists^[At 8 years I made a list of all cars I had seen, classified by brand, country, and year. I didn&#39;t even like cars]. Some time ago I started making a list of all zombie films I&#39;d like to watch.</description>
