# What is **Zombdata**?

**Zombdata** is a database of zombie-related material. It hosts more than 1,400 entries of films, TV shows, videogames, novels, documentaries, press, scientific literature, among others. Each entry includes information about the country it was developed in, its publication/releasing data, author(s), and much more.

# Who is behind **Zombdata**?

I am Gonzalo Garc√≠a-Castro, a researcher at [**Center for Brain and Cognition**](http://upf.com/cbc) at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona, Spain). I spend most of my time doing my PhD in developmental psycholinguistics. My researh is mostly focused on how babies acquire language, with a especial focus on bilingualism. If you are interested in what I should probably be doing instead of writing these lines, you can visit my personal website ([gongcastro.github.io](gongcastro.github.io)).

# Where does **Zombdata** come from?

For some reason^[Not going out very often, basically],  I'm fascinated by wacky zombie movies and books, statistics, and data visualisation. Some time ago, my list of pending zombie movies got too short, and I decided to spend some time adding new ones. I take lists seriously^[Yeah, I may have a problem.], so unsurprisingly this one became a data-base. At some point I decided that such a geeky delight should not be kept in private^[Actually, I had told about it to everyone I had ever crossed two words with.], so **Zombdata** is the result of it. It is now a bit difficult to keep up with the amount of zombie-related material that is published each month around the world, so I decided to make this data-set as reproducible^[This means that whoever wants to run the analysis I post here, she could just go to my [GitHub repository](github.org/gongcastro/Zombdata) and download the correspondent script to run it locally in her computer.] as I could, and to relie on other contributors to keep the database up to date. I've learnt a lot about programming while developing this website, and I plan to keep learning, so plase be patient! I'll try to post new content (data visualisation and #rstats stuff) periodically.

# What to expect from **Zombdata**?

* **Posts**: I plan to post some fancy analysis, graphs^[God, I love graphs], animations, #rstats tutorials (for beginners, as I am myself) and some reviews of zombie material I gobble up.
* **Data**: You can fin the whole data-base in the [**Data**](https://zombdata.netlify.com/data/) section, which hosts a Shiny app that allows to navigate it freely.
* **Contribute**: If you can't find what you are lookin for, and/or want to contribute to the data-base (how nice of you), you can add new entries in the [**Contribute**](https://zombdata.netlify.com/contribute/) section, which hosts a Shiny app where you can include information about your entry, and send it. Your contribution will await for approval (I need to make sure the suggested entry is not a duplicate and that the accompaning info is reliable). Please be as exhaustive as possible with the information you add. When filling the fields in the app, below you will find mathing entries from the data-base. This will make it easier to spot similar entries.

I have many things in mind to do with **Zombdata**, but for now I'll focus on releasing some of the coolest analyses and plots I come up with. I'll try to implement more functionalities as I learn more. Please, enjoy and waste as long as you can watching wacky zombie films that make you learn nothing!
