Hi! In this first post I will tell you a bit about this project, and what to expect from it in the short and mid term.

I love zombie-related material as much as I love making lists^[At 8 years I made a list of all cars I had seen, classified by brand, country, and year. I didn't even like cars]. Some time ago I started making a list of all zombie films I'd like to watch. The list kept growing and it started to become more of a database.

Simultaneously, I had to learn some notions of programming and statistics for work reasons. My zombie database (`Zombdata`), as I started calling it when talking with my friends seemed like a nice opportunity to put in practice some of my (very basic) skills and (little) knowlegde on programming and statistics. Making graphics out of the data turned out to be fun! I started adding more information to `Zombdata`, and it became more comprehensive and interesting^[Probably just to me, as my friends kindly remind me from time to time (I don't blame them: they are probably right).]. I decided to share the results of this *playground* with others, and created this website to do so.

This website will go throught major changes in the next months, as I'm still getting familiar with the RStudio/Blogdown-GitHub-Netlify workflow this website is built onto, so please be patient! I'll try to periodically upload nice data visualisation, reviews of zombie-material, and some notes on my actual research of my thesis at the [Center for Brain and Cognition](http://www.upf.edu/cbc) at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](http://www.upf.edu) that mostly falls into the field of developmental psycholinguistics (whatever that is).

Remember that **nice**, **polite**, **constructive** feed-back is always more than welcome!
